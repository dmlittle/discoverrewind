# DiscoverRewind

![](./assets/og.png)

DiscoverRewind is a tool to automatically archive your weekly [Discover Weekly](https://www.spotify.com/us/discoverweekly) playlists curated by Spotify. You may find the hosted version of this code [here](https://www.discoverrewind.com).

## What does it do?
DiscoverRewind creates an archive copy of the Discover Weekly playlist Spotify curates for you every week allowing you to reference it at a later date.

## WIP features
- [ ] Add the ability to like songs
- [ ] Add the ability to import entire playlist snapshots (or a subset of songs) into a new playlist in your Spotify account.  
- [ ] Automatically add new Discover Weekly songs to a playlist of your choosing every week. 
- [ ] Add the ability to track Daily Mix playlists. These are a bit trickier because they refresh at different rates based on how often you listen to them. Potentially provide the ability to diff the songs between dates?
- [ ] Integrate the [Spotify Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/) to allow you to play songs directly from this app.

## Why build this?
To scratch a personal itch. I find myself often wishing I could reference past song in my Discover Weekly playlist only to find out the playlist has been refreshed by Spotify. Also, why not?
